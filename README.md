# Remember
Desktop application. Dedicated to help people learn information.
I want the app to be ease to use 
I want library with words or content which you can choose to study, there will be packages with words for SAT, TOEFL and etc. 
The main purpose of this project is to make a very strong business logic part which will allow me to produce a mobile or a web versions of the app.
I want it to be beautiful and useful. I want to add there a possibility to take a quiz in the app and to receive notification from the app with words or content you need to revise. 
The hardest points in the app, to consult with Natalie:
- Libraries, how to utilize them properly
- Notifications (Maybe just open new windows)
- Server
# Also great ways to improve the app 
- Active Recall: Test yourself by trying to recall the meaning or usage of a word rather than just rereading it. Active recall strengthens memory more than passive review.
Contextual Learning: Learn words in context (sentences or situations) to enhance their meaning and usage, making them easier to remember.
Use Mnemonics: Create memory aids or associations with the words to make them stick more effectively.
